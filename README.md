# Monitoring Dashboard Insights for VendBridge App User Adoption & Interaction
# Project Background

VendBridge is a newly launched digital marketplace app by NexaLink, operating in the tech industry. The company, active for several years, has a strong focus on product innovation and user-centric solutions. Its business model includes both direct-to-consumer offerings and B2B partnerships. Key metrics that drive decision-making at NexaLink include daily active users (DAUs), app installation rates, transaction counts, and customer retention.

This project focuses on designing an interactive dashboard to monitor the adoption and user engagement of the VendBridge App since its launch. The dashboard aims to provide a visual representation of key performance metrics for tracking app performance.
